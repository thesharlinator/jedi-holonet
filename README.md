This project is a personal sandbox to develop a sample Swagger API with NodeJS and MongoDB (with Swagger-Mongoose) and  Angular as a GUI, and deploy all sides of the applications automatically with Docker Compose in 4 separate containers (Swagger Editor, Database, Services, Application). 

To run:

1. Install Docker & Docker Compose
2. Clone the repository
3. From within the repository, launch: docker-compose up -d
4. Go to http://localhost/ for the GUI, http://localhost:3000/docs for the Swagger UI of the API.
